## AI marketplace

In our marketplace, developers of AI-based solutions
can share the medical image analysis models they create.
The marketplace is accessible directly from the DICOM
image viewer. Any algorithm offered on the platform can
be directly integrated into the viewer. 

The offered algorithms are provided by authors from all over
the world. Available implementations are based on publications
from the best conferences and journals.
We offer both FDA-certified algorithms and non-certified technology
demos that should not be used in medical practice.

If you would like to contact the creator of the model,
a special tab is available. There you can post suggestions,
show incorrect predictions,
or generally discuss with the creator of the solution.  

The available machine learning models focus on image analysis.
We offer models for classification, detection,
semantic image segmentation, or keypoint analysis.
Predictions can be presented to doctors using the built-in visualization
tool.
