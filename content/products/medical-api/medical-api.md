## Medical API

AI models should be provided as a Rest API service to run our cloud infrastructure.

The medical image viewed by the doctor is sent to the model. The AI solution makes a prediction and sends the results back as a visualization. Currently, available models should only be considered suggestions, not diagnoses.

At the moment, the visualization tools support classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, or key-point detection algorithms. 

Models are automatically scaled according to the popularity of a given solution. 
For more information, please visit our [developer blog](https://medvision.io/posts).
Additionally, on our [Github](https://github.com/medvision-io), we provide several examples of deployments that could be used as a starting point for deploying your models.
