## Medical API

Use our infrastructure to host your AI model. 
Within hours you can integrate almost any AI model for medical
image analysis into our platform. 

To show doctors how your model works,
use our visualization tool.
We offer a rich set of features that show doctors
the predictions of your model.
Out-of-the-box visualization support includes object detection,
segmentation masks, heatmaps, image classification,
and keypoint detection.
In case you don't find the solution you are looking for
you can write your own as a React component and use it on our platform.

Our cloud will automatically scale your solution
so that it is available to doctors around the world.
All you need to do is to wrap your solution
in a docker container exposing a Rest API with an endpoint
taking the image and returning the prediction in one of the
supported forms.

Use our built-in DICOM viewer and visualization tool
to deliver your solution faster.
Take advantage of the community of doctors
on the platform who will be able to immediately use
the model you created. Iterate faster and build
a better product with our help.

Additionally, on our [Github](https://github.com/medvision-io), we provide several examples of deployments that could be used as a starting point for deploying your models.
