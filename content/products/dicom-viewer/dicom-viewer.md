## DICOM viewer

![](./image.jpg)

A web browser-based DICOM file viewer is available as part of our platform. 
The viewer supports both 3D and 2D images, and by using WebGL technology,
rendering is as fast as native solutions. 

If needed, the artificial intelligence algorithms available in the platform can be used to analyze the viewed image.
Predictions returned by AI will be overlaid on the input images. A doctor can use any machine learning model available on the platform. 

By using machine learning models,
a doctor can confront his diagnosis with an AI model
and thus improve the quality of patient care.
Predictions of the models should be considered suggestions only and should not be used as final diagnoses. 

Uploaded images are encrypted and stored in the cloud in an individual doctor's account.
If needed, the doctor can generate a link that temporarily shares the image (without personal information) with third parties.
