## DICOM viewer

![](./image.jpg)

A browser-based DICOM file viewer is available as part of our platform. 
The viewer supports both 3D and 2D images, and by using WebGL technology,
rendering is as fast as with native solutions. 

The viewed image can be anonymized with a single click and
shared with another doctor or patient, along with annotations applied to the image. 

If needed, the artificial intelligence algorithms available
in the platform can be used to analyze the viewed image.
The predictions returned by the AI will be overlaid on the input images. The doctor can use any machine learning model available on the platform. 

By using machine learning models,
a doctor can confront their diagnosis with an AI model
and thus improve the quality of patient care.
The predictions of models should only be considered as suggestions and should not be used as final diagnose
